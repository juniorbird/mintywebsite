          <p>
          Run your code through Minty.js to see the state of your variables as each line executes. Can't figure out why you're not getting the output you expect? Minty.js will help you see exactly where things go off the rails.

          <h3>npm install -g minty</h3>
          <p>
          Minty.js is an npm module you install and run on your own development environment, and which outputs to a file in that environment, so that you can be confident you'll get the same results in debugging that you get in production.
